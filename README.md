#  Big Bang Birds - Wheel of Doom

## Description
###     Winds of Freedom

In a dark and lush forest, lives a species of birds that need your help to fly. Help them all to be able to take to the skies and have the freedom to go wherever they want.
Are you up for it?
Click to play and we will be able to see what happens and to whom the experience of reaching the flight through the seven cardinal points of the universe happens.
